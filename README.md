# python

I am Test Engineer with close to 7 years of overall professional experience and I am in love with Python. I like its simple syntax, flexibility of running and testing on wide platform.
I found it also easy and powerful in comparing and handling files. I heard it can also work quite well in dealing with network elements.

I have created this repository to add my python learnings.

Happy Learning. Cheers!

Thanks,
